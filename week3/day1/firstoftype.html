         <h1>Coding is the process of using a programming language to get a computer to behave how you want it to. Every line of code tells the computer to do something, and a document full of lines of code is called a script.

                Each script is designed to carry out a job. This job might be to take an image and change its size. It might play a certain sound or piece of music. When you click like on someoneâ€™s post on social media, a script is what makes it happen.
