            Sometimes Code is Easy to understand

            Coding is the process of using a programming language to get a computer to behave how you want it to. Every line of code tells the computer to do something, and a document full of lines of code is called a script.

            Each script is designed to carry out a job. This job might be to take an image and change its size. It might play a certain sound or piece of music. When you click like on someone’s post on social media, a script is what makes it happen.
            
            Unlike people, computers will do exactly what you tell them to. This might sound great, but it can cause problems. If you tell a computer to start counting upwards, and don’t tell it to stop, it’ll keep counting forever! Being a good programmer is all about knowing how to tell a computer to act.
