<p>
        Coding is the process of using a programming language to get a computer to behave how you want it to. 
        Every line of code tells the computer to do something, and a document full of lines of code is called a script.

        Coding can be very simple, and anyone can learn the basics. A good analogy is to think of coding like books in a library. Some books use simple language, and the stories are easy to understand. Others use very complex words and have stories that seem to make no sense. Whether they are simple or hard to read, they are all books.

        The more books you read, the better you get at it. The complicated language or confusing stories get easier to understand until one day you can read things that you wouldnâ€™t even dream of in the p

        Learning to code is the same. The first time you try to code you will find it hard, but every time you do it you get better. If you find learning a programming language hard, you can still learn the important ideas behind it using a visual coding language.
